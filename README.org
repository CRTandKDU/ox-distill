* Introduction
~ox-distill~ is an export backend for ~org-mode~ to create interactive explanatory articles using the [[https://distill.pub/guide/][Distill web framework]].

With the usual caveat: It's still a work-in-progress, but it works well right now.

* Installation and Usage
~ox-distill~ isn't on MELPA yet, so the ~ox-distill.el~ file has to be simply copied to a directory where Emacs can find it. (The ~site-lisp~ directory is a good place, for instance.)

In your initialization file, then add:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
(require 'ox-distill)
#+END_SRC

or interactively before exporting you ~.org~ source file, invoke ~M-x eval-expression~ followed by ~(require 'ox-distill)~ at the ~Eval:~ prompt.

* Features
~ox-distill~ supports Distill style for front-matter, citations, footnotes and appendix but relies on the ~html~ backend, from which it is derived, for code blocks.

** Front-Matter
The Distill front-matter is built from the following ~org-mode~ keywords at the top of your ~.org~ source file:

    - ~#+TITLE:~ The title of the article
    - ~#+SUBTITLE:~ An optional subtitle
    - ~#+AUTHOR:~ A list of authors separated by a comma (~,~) with no space after the comma
    - ~#+EMAIL:~ A list of ~mailto:~ email addresses for authors, separated by commas, in the same order as above
    - ~#+DISTILL_AFFILIATION:~ A list of affiliation (strings) for authors, separated by commas, in the same order as above
    - ~#+DISTILL_AFFILIATION_URL:~ A list of affiliations URLs for authors, separated by commas, in the same order as above

** Citations
The bibliography for an article is a standard ~bibtex~ file (e.g. see [[http://www.bibtex.org/][bibtex]]). The ~bibtex~ file to be used for publishing an article is set with the following keyword:

    - ~#+DISTILL_BIBFILE: example.bib~ with the name or URL of the ~bibtex~ file

In the body of the article, there are several ways a citation may be inserted:

    - As a link with special keyword ~dtcite:~ as in: ~dtcite:VANEMDEBOAS1989103~, where the reference in the bibliography file appears right after the special keyword
    - As a classical ~org-mode~ link with the syntax:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      [[dtcite:][VANEMDEBOAS1989103]]
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - As an HTML escape sequence using the Distill ~dt-cite~ element:
      #+begin_example
      @@html:<dt-cite key="VANEMDEBOAS1989103">@@ @@html:</dt-cite>@@
      #+end_example

whichever is more convenient.

** Footnotes
~org-mode~ offers a [[https://orgmode.org/manual/Creating-Footnotes.html][comprehensive markup for footnotes]] which can be used with ~ox-distill~. The footnotes appear as usual at the bottom of the document.

~ox-distill~ adds a new markup for /interactive/ footnotes in the Distill style. Such interactive footnotes may be inserted in the body of the text in several ways:
    - As a classical ~org-mode~ link with the syntax:
      #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
      [[dtfn:][The /full/ text of the footnote, including org-mode markup.]]
      #+END_EXAMPLE
    - As an HTML escape sequence using the Distill ~dt-fn~ element:
      #+begin_example
      @@html:<dt-fn>@@The /full/ text of the footnote, including org-mode markup@@html:</dt-fn>@@
      #+end_example

whichever is more convenient.

** Appendix
An optional appendix may be added at the bottom of the document. As offered in the Distill guide, you may wish to include the following sections in your appendix:
  - Acknowledgments: This is a place to recognize people and institutions. It may also be a good place to acknowledge and cite software that makes your work possible (eg. TensorFlow, OpenAI Gym).
  - Author Contributions: We strongly encourage you to include an author contributions statement briefly describing what each author did.

The appendix is a separate ~org-mode~ file, with the recommended (but optional) settings at the top:
#+begin_example
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil
#+OPTIONS: num:nil
#+OPTIONS: html-style:nil
#+end_example

The main article source file indicates the name of the appendix file with the keyword ~#+DISTILL_APPENDIX:~ as in:
#+begin_example
#+DISTILL_APPENDIX: example-appendix.org
#+end_example

* Customizations
~ox-distill~ is derived from ~ox-html~ and all the latter custom variables can be customized for the former, through the ~M-x customize~ usual interface.
